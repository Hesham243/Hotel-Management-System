## 🔎 Background info:

We are developing the Hotel Management System as part of our studies at General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp. We chose to create this platform because we believe in the importance of seamless booking and exceptional hospitality experiences. This project presents a fantastic opportunity for us to hone our skills using Python and Django for both the frontend and backend, while leveraging SQL for our database management.

In addition to building a robust booking system, we are implementing essential features such as real-time availability, user authentication, and secure payment processing. Our focus on creating an intuitive interface and efficient management tools reflects our commitment to enhancing the travel experience for both guests and hotel staff.

We are excited to explore the challenges of this project, as mastering these technologies will be invaluable for our future careers as developers. We believe that our Hotel Management System will not only serve as a practical application of our skills but also contribute to our understanding of the hospitality industry.
